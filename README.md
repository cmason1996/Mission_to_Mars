# Mission_to_Mars

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to gather weather data from MArs by using web scraping and then to take that data and visualize it. This was done to determine the viability of mining operations on the surface of mars as well as some suitable locations. 

## Resources

* Jupyter notebook version 6.8.4

## Summary

As you can see in the images below, the highest pressures and the highest temperaturs follow similar trends. Meaning that both of these times are warmer on the surface of Mars. THe downside to increased atmospheric pressure is that there it is more likely there will be in increased number and severity of storms.
